## Introduction

Virtual Reality (VR) is hot right now. The purpose of this document is to investigate whether VR present an opportunity for FLoV. Would it make sense to spend a bit of money on a pilot project?

Here are some of the roles that VR might play for FLoV:

- An alternative to Zoom and Teams for teaching, research seminars and meetings,
- as an alternative to gathering IRL during a pandemic,
- as a way to get some physical exercise during short breaks away from the computer,
- as a subject for research


## VR Hardware

The Oculus Quest 2 is probably the headset to recommend right now, as it's comparatively cheap (3000 SEK + VAT), is standalone (thus no need to connect it to a computer), and features a large software app store.
