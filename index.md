## Introduction

Virtual Reality (VR) is hot right now. The purpose of this document is to investigate whether VR present an opportunity for FLoV. Would it make sense to spend a bit of money on a pilot project?

Here are some of the roles that VR might play for FLoV and its members:

- An alternative to Zoom and Teams for teaching, research seminars and meetings,
- as a subject for research in some of the areas represented at FLoV, and
- as a way to get some physical exercise during short breaks away from the computer.



## VR Hardware

The Oculus Quest 2 is probably the headset to recommend right now, as it's comparatively cheap (3000 SEK + VAT), is standalone (thus no need to connect it to a computer), and features a large software app store.

A possible problem with Oculus Quest is that it's owned by Facebook - and that a Facebook account is needed to use it.


## VR Software

### Mozilla Hubs

Mozilla Hubs is interesting because it is open source.

Spoke


### Spatial

### FrameVR


## Teaching, meetings and seminars in VR

Zoom is drag, and VR might an alternative to gathering IRL during a pandemic.

### Theoretical philosophy

In [this video](https://www.embodiedphilosophy.com/the-philosophy-of-virtual-reality/) David Chalmers "considers how VR is reframing and shedding new light on some of philosophy’s most enduring questions about cognition, epistemology and the nature of reality."

Searching Google Scholar using the terms "philosophy virtual reality" finds quite a few papers:

### Practical philosophy

Ethical dilemmas

### Logic

Tarski's world



### Linguistics

VR is a communication medium that makes virtual experiences feel real and appear unmediated.

### Computational linguistics

Artificial conversational agents in VR (for gaming, etc.)



### Digital humanities

History.

### Theory of science

Performing e.g. physics experiment in VR rather than IRL.


## Developing VR worlds

Developing VR world for the purpose of studying what's going on in them is feasible. Here too, Mozilla Hubs seems to offer the best possibilities.

## Physical exercise

If nothing else, VR is a great way to release tensions in arms and shoulders after a lengthy work session in front of a computer. Beat Saber is one of the best games for that.
