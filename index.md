## Introduction

Virtual Reality (VR) is hot right now. The purpose of this document is to investigate whether VR presents an opportunity for FLoV, and if it would make sense to spend a bit of money on a pilot project.

Here are some of the roles that VR might play for FLoV and its members:

- An alternative to Zoom and Teams for teaching, research seminars and meetings,
- as a subject for research in some of the areas represented at FLoV, and
- as a way to get some physical exercise during short breaks away from the computer.

Limitations: VR (not AR), web-based


## VR Hardware

The Oculus Quest 2 is probably the headset to recommend right now, as it's comparatively cheap (3000 SEK + VAT), is standalone (thus no need to connect it to a computer), and features a large software app store.

A possible disadvantage is that Oculus Quest is owned by Facebook - and that a Facebook account is needed to use it.

### Mozilla Hubs

[Mozilla Hubs](https://hubs.mozilla.com) is interesting because it is web-based and open source. A Hubs world can be accessed from *any* web browser, in either a VR headset (recommended!) or from a desk computer, mobile phone or tablet. Being web-based means that it inherits important properties from the Web (distributed, decentralized and open). Being open source makes it possible to modify and instrument it for research purposes (more on that later). 

[Spoke](https://hubs.mozilla.com/spoke) is a web-based editor for creating VR worlds that can then be imported into Hubs.

## Teaching, meetings and seminars in VR

Zoom is a drag, and VR might be an alternative to gathering IRL during a pandemic.

## Research involving VR

### Theoretical philosophy

In the following video, David Chalmers "considers how VR is reframing and shedding new light on some of philosophy’s most enduring questions about cognition, epistemology and the nature of reality."

In a longer talk, Chalmers discusses [Spatial Experience and Virtual Reality](https://youtu.be/IN0X0qmc8Lw).

An episode of the [The Voices of VR Podcast](https://voicesofvr.com/) is about a [Primer on Whitehead’s Process Philosophy as a Paradigm Shift & Foundation for Experiential Design](https://voicesofvr.com/primer-on-whiteheads-process-philosophy-as-a-paradigm-shift-foundation-for-experiential-design/)

Searching Google Scholar using the terms "philosophy virtual reality" finds quite a few papers:

### Practical philosophy

Ethical dilemmas

### Linguistics

VR is a communication medium that makes virtual experiences feel real and appear unmediated. Talking to an avatar in VR is almost like talking face-to-face with someone in real life.

### Computational linguistics

Artificial conversational agents in VR.

[Human Interact](https://human-interact.com/)'s Starship Commander.

[AI Voice Commands Enable Diplomacy as a Gameplay Mechanic with "Starship Commander"](http://voicesofvr.com/729-ai-voice-commands-enable-diplomacy-as-a-gameplay-mechanic-with-starship-commander)

which uses AI-enabled, voice-activated commands in order to participate within an interactive story



### Theory of science

Performing e.g. physics experiment in VR rather than IRL.



## Developing VR worlds

Developing VR worlds for the purpose of studying what's going on in them is feasible. Here, as it's [open source](https://github.com/mozilla/hubs), Mozilla Hubs seems to offer the best option. [Here](https://ayman.medium.com/vr-research-in-mozilla-hubs-63fd3002eedf) is an article that describes what is possible.

Here's [my living room](https://hubs.mozilla.com/G4pMrbR/enchanting-tremendous-convention).

## A few more tidbits

Lund University has recently created a [Master's programme in VR and AR](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/lubas/i-uoh-lu-TAVAR). Lund also has a [Virtual Reality Lab](http://www.design.lth.se/english/the-department/research-laboratories/virtual-reality-lab/).




## Physical exercise

If nothing else, VR is a great way to release tensions in arms and shoulders after a lengthy work session in front of a computer. Beat Saber is one of the best games for that.
